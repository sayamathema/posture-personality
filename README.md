Are you a **hunchbacked hermit** or a **power-posing** peacock? We explore the science behind how you stand and how it reflects who you are (without the awkward staring!). 
Work-related back pain is a prevalent condition that frequently impacts the workforce, leading to disability, increased healthcare needs, and a significant socioeconomic impact. Despite the ongoing mystery surrounding the origin of occupational pain, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that both personality and posture play roles in the prolonged management of pain, indicating a direct influence of the mind-body axis. This study aims to thoroughly examine the connections between posture and personality.
To understand the correlation, we took a dataset that studied the relation between a person's level of pain in relation to their age, height, weight, sex, activity level,but most importantly their MBTI personality type.
